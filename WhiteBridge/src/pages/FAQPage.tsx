      questions: [
        {
          question: "How much money can I get?",
          answer: "You can get anywhere from $500 to $100,000. Most people get between $2,000 and $25,000. How much you get depends on how strong your case is and how much it might be worth."
        },
        {
          question: "How fast can I get the money?",
          answer: "Most people get their money in 1-2 days after we approve them. Sometimes we can get you money the same day if you really need it fast."
        },
        {
          question: "Do you check my credit?",
          answer: "No, we don't check your credit at all. Your credit score doesn't matter to us. We only care about your legal case, not your credit history."
        },
        {
          question: "What can I use the money for?",
          answer: "You can use the money for anything you need - rent, food, medical bills, car payments, or anything else. There are no rules about how you spend it."
        }

      category: "‚öñÔ∏è Legal & Case Questions",
      questions: [
        {
          question: "Do I need a lawyer to get money?",
          answer: "Yes, you must have a lawyer helping you with your case. We work with your lawyer to understand your case. If you don't have a lawyer yet, we can help you find one."
        },
        {
          question: "What kinds of cases do you help with?",
          answer: "We help with car accidents, slip and falls, work injuries, medical mistakes, wrongful death, and other injury cases. We don't help with criminal cases, divorce, or bankruptcy."
        },
        {
          question: "Will this hurt my case or my lawyer?",
          answer: "No, getting money from us won't hurt your case at all. Your lawyer stays in complete control of your case. We just give you money while you wait."
        },
        {
          question: "How do I apply?",
          answer: "Just fill out our simple form online or call us at (888) 555-0123. It takes less than 5 minutes. We need your name, phone number, what kind of case you have, and your lawyer's name."

      category: "üìÖ Timeline & Repayment",
      questions: [
        {
          question: "Is this a loan?",
          answer: "No, this is not a loan. We give you money now, and you only pay us back if you win your case. If you lose your case, you don't owe us anything."
        },
        {
          question: "What if I lose my case?",
          answer: "If you lose your case, you don't owe us any money at all. This is completely safe for you. We only get paid if you win. All the risk is on us, not you."
        },
        {
          question: "Do I make monthly payments?",
          answer: "No, you don't make any monthly payments. You don't pay us anything until your case is over. When you win, we get paid from your settlement money through your lawyer."
        },
        {
          question: "How much do I have to pay back?",
          answer: "How much you pay back depends on how long your case takes and what we agreed on. We'll tell you exactly what you'll owe before you take the money. No surprises or hidden fees."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I pay you back early?",
          answer: "Yes, you can pay us back anytime without penalty. If your case ends quickly or you get money from somewhere else, you can pay us back early and might save money on fees."
